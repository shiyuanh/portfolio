I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/newHome.htm">DVMM Lab</a>, Columbia University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang">Shih-Fu Chang</a>. My research interest is computer vision under low-resource scenarios. Specifically, I work actively on efficient multi-modal understanding, compressed video understanding and few-shot learning. 

Prior to the doctoral program, I obtained my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UC San Diego in 2018. I was fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu/?page_id=40m">Truong Nguyen</a> and Prof. <a href="http://terrano.ucsd.edu/jorge/index.html">Jorge Cort√©s</a>. 


<!-- and Prof. <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~helton/">Bill Helton</a>. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
